OOTO (Out Of The Ordinary)
====

OOTO (Out Of The Ordinary) is an application you can deploy in your company to monitor security events and track what might be "out of the ordinary" - meaning maybe you have been breached!

The idea was born out of the fact that no matter how much intrusion protection your company has, if someone wants to get in bad enough they will.  So as well as intrusion, virus and other malware protection, you need to be monitoring what is "normal activity" so that when something becomes "abnormal" you know about it!

The other purpose of building this was as a real world example of Event Sourcing as that is something I want to learn more about and I had to find a real world scenario that called for that architecture.  Hopefully I can get some Event Sourcing gurus reviewing the code and it can become a great sample for how to do Event Sourcing.
